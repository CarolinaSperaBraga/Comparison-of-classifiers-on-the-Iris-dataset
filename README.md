# Comparison of classifiers on the Iris dataset

In this work, we compare the performance of different classification methods considering a division of the dataset into training and testing sets.

The dataset used is the Iris dataset, and classification will be based on the covariates **Sepal.Length** and **Sepal.Width**.

The methods used were,

- Naive Bayes
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- KNN
- Support Vector Machines
- Bagging
- Ada Boosting
